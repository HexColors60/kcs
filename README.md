# KCCI (Kray-G C Compiler & Interpreter)

[![MIT License](http://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg?style=flat)](LICENSE)

Small but Useful C Compiler & Interpreter As an Execution Environment by JIT(x64)/VM.

## Overview

### Features

KCCI is a compact C Compiler and Interpreter.
This compiler has a JIT routine to run the code on the fly.
And this has also a VM execution routine to run the code on the VM.
It is basically same except the performance.

The main feature is below.

*   The language is C, so it is easy to use for almost all programmers.
*   You can execute the code on the fly with JIT or VM like a scripting.
*   KCCI provides a standard C library.
    *   Not completed so far, though. 
    *   See [doc/cstdlib.md](doc/cstdlib.md) for the current status.
*   KCCI also provides useful libraries by default like regex, zip, and so on.
    *   See [doc/extension.md](doc/extension.md) for extended library interface.
    *   See the [samples](samples) because there are some samples about how to use.
    *   Some libraries will be coming soon.
    *   Please let me know if you have library which you want to use.

FYI, please see the [technical notes](doc/technical.md)
if you have any interest in what I have done in the development.
Current topics are below.

*   Loop condition at the bottom of loop
*   Binary search for switch-case
*   Jump table for switch-case
*   Calling convention between Microsoft x64 and System V

### Why not using Clang?

Clang is too big for a light use.
KCCI's goal is a lightweight and easy to use.
If you want to do JIT with Clang, see [clang-jit][] project for your help.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Now KCCI was tested only on a platform below.

*   Windows (x64) with Visual Studio 2017 (Express Edition).
*   Linux (x64) with gcc.

I am waiting for pull requests to support any other platforms & compilers.

### Building & Testing

**Notes for executing:**

To execute `kcc` on Linux or `kcc.exe` on Windows, the files below are required.
Especially for `kccrt` folder will be used at runtime.

```
+-- (installed)
    +-- kccrt
    |   +-- include/*
    |   +-- libsrc/*
    +-- kcc                 (kcc.exe)
    +-- libkcc.so           (libkcc.dll)
    +-- kccbltin.so         (kccbltin.dll)
    +-- kccjit.so           (kccjit.dll)
    +-- kccext.so           (kccext.dll)
```

#### Windows

After installing Visual Studio and prepareing an environment, do make & test as below.

```
C:> make.cmd all test
```

#### Linux

Do make & test KCCI on Linux x64 as below.

```
$ make all test
```

### Architecture

Here is the basic block diagram of KCCI.

## Usage

### Command Line Interface

#### Run Options

The option `-x` will be used by default when no option specified.

```
-x          Run by VM code. (use this when no options specified)
-j          Run by x64 JIT code.
```

#### Input Options

```
-I          Add directory to search for included files.
-D X[=]     Define macro, optionally with a value.
```

#### Output Options

The program will be not run when using one of output options.

```
-E          Output preprocessed code to stdout.
-J          Output x64 code assembled by JIT to stdout.
-X          Output VM code to stdout.
-s          Output GNU style textual x64 assembly to `.s` file.
-dot        Output IR call flow graph in dot format to `.dot` file.
```

## Examples

### How to Run

#### Run on the x64 JIT

For JIT use the option `-j`.
Use the option `-J` if you want to see the x64 assembly code.

```c
// Run on the x64 JIT.
$ kcc -j program.c
// Show the x64 assembly code.
$ kcc -J program.c
```

#### Run on the VM

No options or use the option `-x` to run on the VM.
Use the option `-X` if you want to see the VM instructions.

```c
// Run on the VM.
$ kcc program.c
$ kcc -x program.c
// Show the VM instruction code.
$ kcc -X program.c
```

### Output Call Flow Graph

This is `lacc`'s functionality, but `kcc` can do it also.
Here is the output of call flow graph for switch-case assembled as a jump table.
Please see [here](doc/technical.md) for the detail of a jump table.

![JumpTable](doc/images/switch-case3.png)

### Fibonacci

#### Source Code

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int fib(int n)
{
    if (n < 3) return n;
    return fib(n-2) + fib(n-1);
}

int main()
{
    return printf("%d\n", fib(34));
}
```

#### Dot Output

Although the labels, variable names, and line breaks have been changed for easy to understand,
the output is like below.

```c
digraph {
    node [fontname="Courier_New",fontsize=10,style="setlinewidth(0.1)",shape=record];
    edge [fontname="Courier_New",fontsize=10,style="setlinewidth(0.1)"];
    label="fib"
    labelloc="t"
    L1 [label="{ \.L1 | if 3 \> n goto \.L2 }"];
    L3 [label="{ \.L3 | .t1 = n - 2 | param .t1 | .t2 = call &fib |
                        .t3 = n - 1 | param .t3 | .t4 = call &fib | return .t2 + .t4 }"];
    L2 [label="{ \.L2 | return n }"];
    L1:s -> L3:n;
    L1:s -> L2:n;
}
```

The image is like this.

#### Execution Sample

The results are below.

```c
$ kcc -j fib.c
9227465

$ kcc fib.c
9227465
```

#### Benchmark

Maybe it will depend on the environment.
Here is one of samples on Windows, and it is an execution time in seconds.
For the reference, it shows a result of Ruby and Python.

|           | KCCI VM(64bit) | KCCI JIT(x64) | Ruby 2.4.0 | Ruby 2.6.3 | Python 2.7.13 |
| --------- | :------------: | :-----------: | :--------: | :--------: | :-----------: |
| `fib(34)` |     0.453      |   **0.062**   |   1.171    |   0.734    |     1.578     |

I was able to make my VM faster than Ruby this time,
but Ruby 2.6.3 is very fast against my expectations in spite of no type information.
Of course x64 JIT code is 7x or 8x faster than that VM code.

#### Compiled Code

Here is a compiled x64 code and a VM instructions.
Those are very long and it includes also lots of library code,
so it shows the fib function only.

##### x64 assembly code

###

## Todo List

I have a plan to do the followings when I have a time.

*   [ ] Providing all of Standard C Library.
*   [ ] Adding a library of XML Parser.
*   [ ] Adding a library with libCurl.
*   [ ] Supporting encryption of Zip/Unzip.
*   [ ] Adding [JSONPath][] for JSON parser.

[JSONPath]: http://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/

## Acknowledgments

I am very appreciative of many Open Source projects.

In particular, [lacc][], which is a very compact C compiler,
has a frontend and a backend separated well.
That was why I could add a VM very easily.
In fact I wrote my own C parser at first,
but I replaced it by [lacc][] because it was very easy to add a new backend.

Note that a lot of modifications were done for the old code base of [lacc][],
so it can not apply the latest one.
The main modifications are:

*   For Windows JIT, adapting calling convention between Microsoft x64 and System V.
*   Linking the compiled function for JIT on the fly.
*   Replacing types to build it with Visual Studio.
*   Some bug fixes.

And special thanks to the following products for useful test codes.
