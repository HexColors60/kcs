# KCCI (Kray-G C Compiler & Interpreter)

[![MIT License](http://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg?style=flat)](LICENSE)

Small but Useful C Compiler & Interpreter As an Execution Environment by JIT(x64)/VM.

## Overview

### Features

KCCI is a compact C Compiler and Interpreter.
This compiler has a JIT routine to run the code on the fly.
And this has also a VM execution routine to run the code on the VM.
It is basically same except the performance.

The main feature is below.

*   The language is C, so it is easy to use for almost all programmers.
*   You can execute the code on the fly with JIT or VM like a scripting.
*   KCCI provides a standard C library.
    *   Not completed so far, though. 
    *   See [doc/cstdlib.md](doc/cstdlib.md) for the current status.
*   KCCI also provides useful libraries by default like regex, zip, and so on.
    *   Some libraries will be coming soon.
    *   Please let me know if you have library which you want to use.

### Why not using Clang?

Clang is too big for a light use.
KCCI's goal is a lightweight and easy to use.
If you want to do JIT with Clang, see [clang-jit][] project for your help.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Now KCCI was tested only on a platform below.

*   Windows (x64) with Visual Studio 2017 (Express Edition).
*   Linux (x64) with gcc/g++.

I am waiting for pull requests to support any other platforms & compilers.

### Building & Testing

**Notes for executing:**

To execute `kcc` on Linux or `kcc.exe` on Windows, the files below are required.
Especially for `kccrt` folder will be used at runtime.

```
+-- (installed)
    +-- kccrt
    |   +-- include/*
    |   +-- libsrc/*
    +-- kcc                 (kcc.exe)
    +-- libkcc.so           (kcclib.dll)
    +-- kccbltin.so         (kccbltin.dll)
    +-- kccjit.so           (kccjit.dll)
    +-- kccext.so           (kccext.dll)
```

#### Windows

After installing Visual Studio and prepareing an environment, do make & test as below.

```
C:> make.cmd all test
```

#### Linux

Do make & test KCCI on Linux x64 as below.

```
$ make all test
```

### Architecture

Here is the basic block diagram of KCCI.

## Usage

### Run on the x64 JIT

For JIT use the option `-j`.
Use the option `-J` if you want to see the x64 assembly code.

```c
// Run on the x64 JIT.
$ kcc -j program.c
// Show the x64 assembly code.
$ kcc -J program.c
```

### Run on the VM

No options or use the option `-x` to run on the VM.
Use the option `-X` if you want to see the VM instructions.

```c
// Run on the VM.
$ kcc program.c
$ kcc -x program.c
// Show the VM instruction code.
$ kcc -X program.c
```

## Examples

### Fibonacci

#### Source Code

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int fib(int n)
{
    if (n < 3) return n;
    return fib(n-2) + fib(n-1);
}

int main()
{
    return printf("%d\n", fib(34));
}
```

#### Execution Sample

The results are below.

```c
$ kcc -j fib.c
9227465

$ kcc fib.c
9227465
```

#### Benchmark

Maybe it will depend on the environment.
Here is one of samples on Windows, and it is an execution time in seconds.
For the reference, it shows a result of Ruby and Python.

|           | KCCI VM(64bit) | KCCI JIT(x64) | Ruby 2.4.0 | Ruby 2.6.3 | Python 2.7.13 |
| --------- | :------------: | :-----------: | :--------: | :--------: | :-----------: |
| `fib(34)` |     0.718      |   **0.062**   |   1.171    |   0.734    |     1.578     |

Ruby 2.6.3 is very fast against my expectations.

#### Compiled Code

Here is a compiled x64 code and a VM instructions.
Those are very long and it includes also lots of library code,
so it shows the fib function only.

##### x64 assembly code

$ kcc -J fib.c

## Todo List

I have a plan to do the followings when I have a time.

*   [ ] Providing all of Standard C Library.
*   [ ] Adding a library of SQLite3.
*   [ ] Adding a library of XML Parser.
*   [ ] Adding a library of JSON Parser.
*   [ ] Adding a library with libCurl.
*   [ ] Supporting encryption of Zip/Unzip.
*   [ ] Supporting jump table for switch-case.
*   [ ] One instruction for increment and decrement.
*   [ ] Combining VM instructions to improve the performance.
*   [ ] Building libkcc to use it as a shared library.

## Acknowledgments

I am very appreciative of many Open Source projects.

In particular, [lacc][], which is a very compact C compiler,
has a frontend and a backend separated well.
That was why I could add a VM very easily.
In fact I wrote my own C parser at first,
but I replaced it by [lacc][] because it was very easy to add a new backend.

Note that a lot of modifications were done for the old code base of [lacc][],
so it can not apply the latest one.
The main modifications are:

*   For Windows JIT, adapting calling convention between Microsoft x64 and System V.
*   Linking the compiled function for JIT on the fly.
*   Replacing types to build it with Visual Studio.
*   Some bug fixes.

And special thanks to the following products for useful test codes.
